a. Rectangular array, one row per record
b. Columns can be of different types, but all the same length
4. Lists
a. Like a vector, but each element can be almost anything
b. E.g., elements of a list can be vectors, dataframes or other lists
c. Different elements of a list can be different sizes and types
